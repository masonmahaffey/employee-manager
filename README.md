# README

#### Working on adding an entirely comprehensive description of everything... I've just run out of time so I haven't had the chance to do so!

## Getting Started

1. git clone the project down
2. npm install
3. install any dependencies missing from package.json (I haven't had a chance to check)
4. Add the .env I've provided to brock
